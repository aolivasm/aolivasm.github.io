I am a **PhD candidate** in **Biostatistics** at the **University of Washington**, with a background in **Mathematics** (University of Sonora) and **Internal Medicine** (INCMNSZ/UNAM). My main research focuses on developing statistical methods for estimating causal effects of continuous exposures in the presence of unmeasured confounding levaraging the existence of strong proxies of the unmeasured confounders. One of the main applications of this work is identifying **correlates of protection in vaccine trials**, which aims to uncover immune markers that reliably predict vaccine efficacy and improve vaccine trial design.

Beyond my current research, I have contributed to various projects, including:

- **Non-Inferiority Trials**: Developing a framework for active-controlled trials with **Dr. Holly Janes**.
- **Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy**: Conducting individual patient data meta-analyses to assess benefits for heart failure patients with **Dr. Lurdes Inoue**.
- **Cancer Screening**: Investigating bias in test sensitivity estimates with **Dr. Ruth Etzioni**.

I also collaborate with the **INCMNSZ** on research related to **COVID-19**, **HIV/AIDS**, **antimicrobial resistance**, **cancer**, and **gastrointestinal diseases**. Additionally, I am a member of **Mexicans in Statistics and Health**, a group dedicated to making complex scientific topics accessible to a broader audience.

My research interests include **proximal causal inference**, **machine learning**, **clinical trials**, and **screening tests**, with a focus on advancing statistical methods to improve health outcomes.
