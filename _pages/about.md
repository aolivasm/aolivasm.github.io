I am a PhD candidate in **Biostatistics** at the **University of Washington**, with a background in **Mathematics** (University of Sonora) and **Internal Medicine** (INCMNSZ/UNAM). My primary research focuses on extending the **proximal causal inference** framework to estimate causal effects of continuous exposures. This framework, which leverages strong proxies for unmeasured confounders, has been widely applied to other causal estimands. My work specifically aims to refine and develop methods for causal inference in the context of continuous exposures. A major application of this work is identifying **correlates of protection in vaccine trials**, where the goal is to uncover immune markers that reliably predict vaccine efficacy and improve trial design.

In addition to my core research, I have contributed to several collaborative projects, including:

- **Non-Inferiority Trials**: Developing a framework for non-inferiority assessment of new interventions in active-controlled trials with **Dr. Holly Janes**.
- **Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy**: Leading individual patient data meta-analyses to evaluate benefits for heart failure patients with **Dr. Lurdes Inoue**.
- **Cancer Screening**: Investigating biases in test sensitivity estimates with **Dr. Ruth Etzioni**.

I also collaborate with the **INCMNSZ** on research related to **COVID-19**, **HIV/AIDS**, **antimicrobial resistance**, **cancer**, and **gastrointestinal diseases**. Additionally, I am a member of **Mexicans in Statistics and Health**, a group focused on making complex scientific topics accessible to a broader audience.

My research interests include **proximal causal inference**, **semiparametric efficiency theory**, **machine learning**, **clinical trials**, and **screening tests**, with a focus on advancing statistical methods to improve health outcomes.
