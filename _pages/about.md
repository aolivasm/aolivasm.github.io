I am a **biostatistician (PhD, University of Washington)** and **medical doctor (internal medicine, INCMNSZ/UNAM)** with a background in **Mathematics (University of Sonora)**. My PhD dissertation, *Advances in Proximal Inference for Continuous Exposures, Estimation of Ill-Posed Regression, and Non-Inferiority Assessment in Active-Controlled Trials*, was supervised by **Dr. Andrea Rotnitzky** (proximal inference and ill-posed regression) and **Dr. Holly Janes** (non-inferiority trials).

I am currently a **Postdoctoral Researcher** at the **Center for Causal Inference at the University of Pennsylvania**, working on statistical methods for predicting outcomes of *in vitro* fertilization therapy.

My research has focused on **causal inference**, **machine learning**, **clinical trials**, and **cancer screening**, with applications including:

- **Correlates of Protection in Vaccine Trials**: Identifying immune markers that reliably predict vaccine efficacy and allow for unmeasured confounding.
- **Non-Inferiority Trials**: Developing a framework for assessing non-inferiority of new interventions with active-controlled trials.
- **Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy**: Conducting individual patient data meta-analyses to assess benefits of cardiac resynchronization therapy in patients with heart failure.
- **Cancer Screening**: Investigating bias in test sensitivity estimates.

I also collaborate with the **INCMNSZ** on research related to **COVID-19**, **HIV/AIDS**, **antimicrobial resistance**, **cancer**, and **gastrointestinal diseases**. Additionally, I am a member of **Mexicans in Statistics and Health**, a group dedicated to making complex scientific topics accessible to a broader audience.

My research interests include **causal inference**, **machine learning**, **clinical trials**, and **screening tests**, with a focus on advancing statistical methods to improve health outcomes.
