I am a biostatistician (PhD, University of Washington) and medical doctor (internal medicine, INCMNSZ/UNAM) with a background in Mathematics (University of Sonora). I am currently a **Postdoctoral Researcher** in the **Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology, and Informatics** at the **University of Pennsylvania**, where I am affiliated with both the **Center for Causal Inference** and the **Center for Health Innovations in Reproductive and Perinatal Population Research (CHIRP)**. My research focuses on **causal inference at the intersection with semiparametric theory**, developing methods to address complex problems in biomedical and clinical research. Within CHIRP, I work on projects related to __in vitro__ fertilization outcomes, developing models to estimate the probability of success for couples undergoing IVF.

During my PhD, I developed statistical methods for causal inference in complex settings, including **proximal causal inference and estimation in ill-posed regression problems** (supervised by Dr. Andrea Rotnitzky) and **frameworks for non-inferiority assessment in active-controlled trials** (supervised by Dr. Holly Janes).

My broader research interests include **causal inference**, **semiparametric theory**, **distribution-free inference**, **clinical trials**, and **screening tests**, with a focus on developing statistical methodology that supports rigorous and reliable decision-making in health research.
