I am a biostatistician (PhD, University of Washington) and medical doctor (internal medicine, INCMNSZ/UNAM) with a background in Mathematics (University of Sonora). My doctoral research focused on developing statistical methods for causal inference in complex settings, including **proximal causal inference and estimation in ill-posed regression problems** (supervised by Dr. Andrea Rotnitzky) and **frameworks for non-inferiority assessment in active-controlled trials** (supervised by Dr. Holly Janes).

I am currently a **Postdoctoral Researcher** at the **Center for Causal Inference at the University of Pennsylvania**, working on proximal causal inference and prediction methods for clinical research, including outcomes in *in vitro* fertilization therapy.

My research interests include **causal inference**, **prediction methods**, **clinical trials**, and **screening tests**, with a focus on advancing statistical methods to improve health outcomes.
