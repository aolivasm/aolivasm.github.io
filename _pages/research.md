## Methodological Work
- **Source-Condition Analysis of Kernel Adversarial Estimators** — *arXiv preprint* (2025).  
  *Finite-sample analysis of RKHS-regularized adversarial estimators for ill-posed regression, comparing stability and assumptions with existing methods.*  
  [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17181)

## Collaborative Projects
- **Test Sensitivity in a Prospective Cancer Screening Program: A Critique of a Common Proxy Measure** — Co-author, *Statistical Methods in Medical Research* (2023).  
  *Analyzed the relationship between empirical and true sensitivity in cancer screening programs, clarifying conditions under which proxy measures can misrepresent diagnostic performance.*  
  [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1177/09622802221142529)
- **Sensitivity Measures in Studies of Cancer Early Detection Biomarkers** — Co-author, *Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention* (2025).  
  *Investigated how sensitivity estimates from different phases of biomarker development relate to true preclinical sensitivity, highlighting biases that can arise across study designs and screening intervals.*
