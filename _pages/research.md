## Methodological Work
- **Source-Condition Analysis of Kernel Adversarial Estimators** — *arXiv preprint* (2025).  
  *Finite-sample analysis of RKHS-regularized adversarial estimators for ill-posed regression, comparing stability and assumptions with existing methods.*  
  [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17181)
- **Proximal Causal Inference for Modified Treatment Policies** — *arXiv preprint* (2025).  
  *Extends proximal causal inference to estimate mean outcomes under modified treatment regimes with continuous exposures and unmeasured confounding, leveraging negative controls and debiased machine learning with flexible nonparametric nuisance estimation, motivated by vaccine immunobridging studies.*  
  [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12038)
- **A General Framework for Designing and Evaluating Active-Controlled Trials with Non-Inferiority Objectives** — *arXiv preprint* (2025).  
  *Framework integrating existing analytical methods and success criteria, enabling systematic comparison of type I error, power, and robustness, and providing a toolkit for rigorous non-inferiority trial design and method selection.*  
  [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22071)

## Collaborative Projects
- **Immune Correlates and Vaccine Immunobridging: Statistical Innovations, Challenges, and Opportunities** — Co-author, *The Journal of infectious diseases* (2025). 
  *Overview of recent statistical developments relevant to immunobridging, including variable importance prediction for correlates of risk, controlled risk causal analysis for correlates of protection, and vaccine efficacy transportability methods.*
  [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiaf451)
- **Test Sensitivity in a Prospective Cancer Screening Program: A Critique of a Common Proxy Measure** — Co-author, *Statistical Methods in Medical Research* (2023).  
  *Analyzed the relationship between empirical and true sensitivity in cancer screening programs, clarifying conditions under which proxy measures can misrepresent diagnostic performance.*  
  [DOI](https://doi.org/10.1177/09622802221142529)
- **Sensitivity Measures in Studies of Cancer Early Detection Biomarkers** — Co-author, *Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention* (2025).  
  *Investigated how sensitivity estimates from different phases of biomarker development relate to true preclinical sensitivity, highlighting biases that can arise across study designs and screening intervals.*
